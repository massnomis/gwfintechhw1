## Compound Finance is an on-chain Money Market protocol

The protocol is built on ethereum, using solidity contracts to allow user to interact in a way described as "peer to pool"

Users can lend idle assets to earn interest on their money

Users can then borrow assets against their deposits, as much as their "cratio" or collateralization ratio permits

Borrowers pay interest on their borrowings, and a certain percentage "rratio" or reserve ratio of the interterst paid goes towards the protocols reserves.

## Governance

Compound has distributed tokens which allow holders to vote on protocol upgrades

## Long term Outlook

they are develpoping compound.cash on a gateway chanel, allowing for cheap transactions
